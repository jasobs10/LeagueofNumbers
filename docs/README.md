## Technologies & APIs
* JavaScript
* D3.js
* Riot Games API

The Riot Games API will provide player data and match data. The chart will be built using an SVG element, with plots rendered on it using D3.js.

## Implementation Timeline

### Day 1
Learn how to render chart with D3 library. Get data needed from Riot API to render basic statistics. Figure out how to limit API calls.

### Day 2
Add more data, and begin colorizing stats. Keep track of highly visited coordinates, which will be heat mapped.

### Day 3
Add filters and user interactions
